		<h1> What would these skills be good for?</h1>
			<p> The skills that I am learning in class would be able to help design websites and different animations to decorate those websites. Now, that I am enhancing my skills I will be able to make better websites and cool animations. These skills would also look good on my college applications.

I think it is the coolest thing.I am so happy I joined this class because now I am able to enhance my skills.</p>
