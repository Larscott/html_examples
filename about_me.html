						<h1>My First Career</h1>

						<p>Volleyball is a sport of stratagy. Every move you make effects the game. You need to have good chemistry with your team mates an you need to have great commutnication. The reason I play volleyball is because my entire family plays it, it runs in my blood. I also love the game.</p>

						<h3>My Second Career</h3>
						<p>I want to join the career of Web Designing because I love to design websites. Web Designing is a lot of work because you need to memorize all of the code, but it is still a lot of fun.</p>

						<p>In Web Design you need to understand how to organize your browser. That may be a little hard, but soon enough you'll get the hang of it. I love to design website because of the challenge. When my code is wrong I have to go back and fix it. That may not be the life other people want, but I always love a hard challenge.</p>
